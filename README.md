# evasive-keyboard
A keyboard that evades the user, made for Hack Club Undercity!

## What is it?
This is an elaborate setup where an unknowing user will use this little keyboard and then use it, where they find the keyboard would not like for them to be used.

## How does it work?
This hardware allows one to track if a user is about to type or not, which, would split the keyboard apart, depending on the output.
